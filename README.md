# foundata: guidelines, conventions, standards and related documents

This repository collects recommendations and rules [foundata](https://foundata.com/) is using to create creative work (which includes source code) or doing operations. What makes sense to share in public will find its place in this repository.


## Table of contents

* [Ansible](#ansible)
* [Licensing](#licensing)
* [Notes on the continuous release of guidelines and related documents](#continuous-release)


## Ansible<a id="ansible"></a>

[Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) is a simple, agentless IT automation tool.

* [Ansible style guide (`ansible-style-guide.md`)](./ansible-style-guide.md)
* [Showcase playbook to clarify the Ansible style guide (`ansible-style-guide-example.yml`)](./ansible-style-guide-example.yml)


## Licensing<a id="licensing"></a>

Resources on how to choose, apply or change a license.

* [How to choose a license (`licensing-how-to-choose-a-license.md`)](./licensing-how-to-choose-a-license.md)
* [How to apply licenses (`licensing-how-to-apply.md`)](./licensing-how-to-apply.md)


## Notes on the continuous release of guidelines and related documents<a id="continuous-release"></a>

Our guides are updated continuously, meaning:

* Changes are immediately put "live" by publishing them after a review.
* There is no special versioning, neither for the documents themselves nor for the repository.
* As Git and a repository hosting are used, permanent links to specific "versions" are still easy and possible if needed.

We believe that guides are work in progress and will probably never be finished as our understanding of each topic evolves. This fits our overall agile approach.
