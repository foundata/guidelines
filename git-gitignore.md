# Git: `gitignore` configuration

The `gitignore` config is used to specify intentionally untracked files. There are [several places](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore#_synopsis) to define it. A `.gitignore` file is the usual, easily accessible per-repository option which is easily shared among all developers as part of the repository itself.

## Default starting point for a repository's `.gitignore`<a id="gitignore-file-default"></a>

Please use the **latest release of <https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore/api/git,vim,linux,macos,windows,jetbrains+all,visualstudiocode> as default for a `.gitignore`** file.



## Project specific / additional files to ignore<a id="gitignore-file-extend"></a>

Please **add any non-template, repository-specific excludes below `# End of https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore[...]`**. This keeps everything easily maintainable.

Extend the `.gitignore` file as needed for your project, based on the tools you use (e.g. Ansible, Chocolatey, certain build tools, …). You can access [Toptal's .gitignore.io WebUI pre-configured with our default](https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore?templates=git,vim,linux,macos,windows,jetbrains+all,visualstudiocode) to easily add additional `gitignore`-templates.



## Reasoning<a id="reasoning"></a>

It is primarily every developer's responsibility to avoid pushing unwanted files (such as temporary or backup files, logs, previews, etc.) and to configure their Git setup accordingly—especially when using an uncommon toolset. However, **it is still beneficial to define defaults for ignoring files generated by widely-used tools**, as this simplifies workflows and reduces friction. This approach helps prevent common mistakes in pull requests, particularly from individuals who don't work with Git or a specific repository regularly.

After reviewing usage patterns within our organization and among our peers, we have decided to ignore likely unwanted files from the following components by default:

- Git
- Linux and common tools (e.g., Thunar, Nautilus)
- macOS and common tools (e.g., Finder)
- Microsoft Windows and common tools (e.g., File Explorer)
- [Vim](https://www.vim.org/)
- [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [JetBrains Toolset (complete suite / all IDEs)](https://www.jetbrains.com/products)
